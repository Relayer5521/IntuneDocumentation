## Usage Intune Documentation

Since version 2.0.0 the Automatic Intune Documentation script is available in th PowerShell Gallery and therefore its much simpler to install and use it. You can just use these two commands:

```powershell

Install-Module IntuneDocumentation
Invoke-IntuneDocumentation -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\IntuneDoc.docx

```

**Important:** Before using the Script the first time, you have to ensure, that you have installed the Microsoft.Graph.Intune and PSWord Module. To do that, you have to start PowerShell as an Adminstrator and install them:

```powershell

Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Intune
Install-Module PSWord

```

## Usage Conditional Access Documentation

You can just use these two commands:

**Important:** The Conditional Access Policy Documentation does not support login with interactive credentials. Therefore, it's required to create a custom app which can be done by calling 'New-IntuneDocumentationAppRegistration'. I recommend saving the result in a password vault and using always the same client secret.

```powershell

# If you have already have the modulte installed then you can skip the first command. 
Install-Module IntuneDocumentation
# If App registration already exists it will only creade new CLient Secret. If you know the existing from a previous execution you can skip the next line.
$clientCreds = New-IntuneDocumentationAppRegistration -TokenLifetimeDays 5
Invoke-ConditionalAccessDocumentation -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\CADoc.docx -ClientId $clientCreds.ClientId -Tenant $clientCreds.TenantId -ClientSecret $clientCreds.ClientSecret

```

## Additional Options

### UseTranslationBeta

When using this parameter the API names will be translated to the labels used in the Intune Portal.
Note:
These Translations need to be created manually, only a few are translated yet. If you are willing
to support this project. You can do this by [translating the json files](https://github.com/ThomasKur/IntuneDocumentation/blob/master/AddTranslation.md) which are mentioned to you when you generate the documentation in your tenant.

```powershell

Invoke-IntuneDocumentation -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\IntuneDoc.docx -UseTranslationBeta

```

### Use script silently

In the past I got requests that users would like to execute the Intune Documentation script silently. I have now extended the script by two new option and a new functions which can automatically create the App Registration in Azure AD for you. 

#### Automatically Create App Registration

Your account requires Global Admin privileges to execute these commands and you need to have the AzureAD Module installed.

```powershell

$p = New-IntuneDocumentationAppRegistration
$p | fl

```

The following result will be displayed and can then be used. Safe the ClientSecret in your password vault.

```powershell

ClientID               : d5cf6364-82f7-4024-9ac1-73a9fd2a6ec3
ClientSecret           : S03AESdMlhLQIPYYw/cYtLkGkQS0H49jXh02AS6Ek0U=
ClientSecretExpiration : 21.07.2025 21:39:02
TenantId               : d873f16a-73a2-4ccf-9d36-67b8243ab99a

```

#### Manually Create App Registration

You can follow the manual of Michael Niehaus https://oofhours.com/2019/11/29/app-based-authentication-with-intune/

But select also the following permission scopes:

- 'Policy.Read.All'
- 'Directory.Read.All'
- 'DeviceManagementServiceConfig.Read.All'
- 'DeviceManagementRBAC.Read.All'
- 'DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All'
- 'DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All'
- 'DeviceManagementApps.Read.All'
- 'Device.Read.All'
- 'Agreement.Read.All'
- 'Application.Read.All'

#### Generate Documentation without user interaction

You can now call the Intune Documentation with the new parameters:

```powershell

Invoke-IntuneDocumentation `
    -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\IntuneDoc.docx `
    -ClientId d5cf6364-82f7-4024-9ac1-73a9fd2a6ec3 `
    -ClientSecret S03AESdMlhLQIPYYw/cYtLkGkQS0H49jXh02AS6Ek0U= `
    -Tenant d873f16a-73a2-4ccf-9d36-67b8243ab99a

```
